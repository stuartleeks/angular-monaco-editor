# Monaco editor

Work in progress sample to integrate [monaco editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) with angularjs v1

## TODO

This is an early stage project. There are still some significant pieces of work to be done, including:

* Set up gulp to copy monaco-editor to app/libs/monaco-editor
* Look for an appropriate event on monaco editor to sync changes to the code back to the angular scope
